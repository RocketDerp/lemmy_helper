# lemmy-helper

Lemmy social media, federated application

This is an attempt to create a SvelteKit webapp for server operators to work directly with the PostgreSQL database tables. Work in progress / unstable project. Quick and dirty, proof of concept.

# Discussion

Lemmy social media community for this project: https://lemmy.ml/c/lemmy_helper

# Intended to be safe way to operate a server

It does read-only operations of the Lemmy database.

# Download code and build project

You will need NodeJS installed on your system. I used pnpm to do the project creation and install, you can likely use normal npm or yarn (untested). To build project:

```
git clone https://github.com/RocketDerp/lemmy_helper.git
cd lemmy_helper
pnpm install
```

# PostgreSQL username and password

PGUSER and PGPASSWORD environment variables are utilized by the NodeJS pg library used in the app. You can temporarily set these variables before the `npm run` command (example uses pnpm):

`PGUSER=lemmy PGPASSWORD=mypassword pnpm run dev --host --port 9000`


# sample nginx.confg

A sample nginx.config file is here on this project root. It uses a different hostname to route access to the admin.

1. You need to add a new CNAME alias to your DNS, such as lemmyadmin.example.com
2. You will need to change to your Internet domain name from the included "exmaple.com" in the nginx.conf file
3. generate the certifiate for your new hostname with Linux shell command: `certbot certonly --nginx`
4. run this application on port 9000.

NOTE: there is no login or password on this site, it doees mostly safe read-only queries, although resetting the pg_stats is one write-operation.
